# A taste of APIs
This was an evening of fun with APIs taken from [this assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/exploring_apis.markdown).


### NYTimes API
To access the New York Times via its [Top Stories API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top_stories_api/), run the program `ruby top_stories.rb <section> <nstories>` from the command line. The section and number of stories are optional arguments and default to science and 10, respectively.
